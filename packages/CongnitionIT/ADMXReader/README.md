# ADMXReader
This PowerShell script was created to make ADMX files more readable in regards to the registry keys and values that are set with each policy setting.

I created this script to quickly retrieve the registry keys that are being configured with the ADMX file for the different (downloadable) Citrix ADMX files, like the files for Citrix Receiver, Citrix Profile Manager, Citrix ShareFile and Citrix Workspace Environment Management.

Feel free to use the script or provide me with feedback to improve the script.

Cheers,
Esther
